                Having grown up involved in sports and focused on a career in Mechanical Engineering, it was a
                surprise
                to
                many when Moriah decided to shift into an acting career. As a naturally soft-spoken and reserved
                introvert,
                acting isn't something most people think of when it comes to changing gears. But she has many
                layers,
                and
                beneath the surface there's booming personality, talent and drive to make a name for herself in the
                entertainment industry!

                So, why acting? “From giving a gift, to sarcasm and silliness, making somebody smile, laugh, or
                positively impacting someone in some way is always a highlight of my day. Acting is a way to do this
                and
                reach more than the few I encounter on a regular basis. There's not much that I love more than
                bringing
                a character to life and being able to witness how I've impacted the audience. It's one of my
                greatest
                blessings and I pray my work is a blessing to everyone it touches in return”.
